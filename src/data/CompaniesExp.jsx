        As a Junior ReactJs Developer at Connectlab since October 2021, I've
        been actively engaged in crafting high-quality and robust production
        code for various mental health websites and web portals. My development
        toolkit includes a range of technologies such as ReactJS, Next.js, HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript.
        <br />
        <br />
        One of my notable achievements during my tenure has been the substantial
        improvement in Next.js website performance. Through optimization
        efforts, I boosted website loading speed from 33% to an impressive 99%,
        ensuring a swift and seamless user experience while maintaining
        cross-browser compatibility.
        <br />
        <br />
        Collaboration has been a cornerstone of my work at Connectlab. Working
        closely with designers, I've been responsible for translating their
        creative visions into reality, implementing responsive designs, and
        achieving pixel-perfect layouts for websites. This attention to detail
        has contributed to the overall aesthetic appeal and user-friendliness of
        our projects.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition to performance enhancements and design implementation, I've
        also played a role in enhancing security and functionality. This
        includes the implementation of Crash Analytics for web portals and the
        integration of Google reCAPTCHA for secure authentication, reinforcing
        the integrity and safety of our web applications.
        <br />
        <br />
        Furthermore, I've had the opportunity to develop HTML Email Templates
        for mailers using SendGrid, contributing to effective communication and
        outreach strategies.
        <br />
        <br />
        In summary, my role as a Junior ReactJs Developer at Connectlab has
        allowed me to make significant contributions to web development
        projects, ranging from performance optimization to responsive design
        implementation and security enhancements. I look forward to continuing
        to drive innovation and excellence in this dynamic role.
