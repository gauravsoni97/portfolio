        I have created the Money Management Tool, a web-based application that
        helps users manage their finances based on the 50-30-20 rule of
        budgeting. Users can edit and delete existing notes, and the application
        provides data storage to keep track of the user's financial history and
        progress over time. Through the development of this application, I have
        gained expertise in web development, data storage.
